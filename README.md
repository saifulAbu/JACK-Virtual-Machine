# Virtual-Machine
A virtual machine implementation that takes instructions for JACK VM and translates code for [HACK Architecture](https://github.com/saifulAbu/HACK-Architecture). Output of this VM will be input to the [HACK Assembler](https://github.com/saifulAbu/Assembler). I have implemented all the components for this VM from scratch following specification from the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686). JACK compiler is the following project of this VM. The compiler will be translating a program written in the JACK language targetted for this VM.

To understand and run the project, reader needs to read the book mentioned above.
