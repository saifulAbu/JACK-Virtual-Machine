# Virtual-Machine
A virtual machine implementation that takes instructions for JACK VM and translates code for HACK architecture. All the components for this VM was made from scratch following specification from the book (The Elements of Computing Systems)[https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686]. I have also implemented HACK assembler and HACK architecture from the scratch. JACK compiler is the following project of this VM.
